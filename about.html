  <h2>About Me</h2>
  I am a computer programming student at Athabasca University.
  I began programming by teaching myself C++ from a textbook
  (Sam's Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days).

  <h2>My Projects</h2>
  <h3>Self-Driving Car</h3>
  For my final project in COMP 444, Embedded-Robotic Programming,
  at Athabasca University, I collaborated with my brother to build
  a Self-Driving Car that used Computer Vision and AI to autonomously
  navigate around a track.
